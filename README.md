# Data and Society Project: Low Income Jobs Lost Due to COVID-19 
Project repo for data and society course (DAT 4500) :bulb::pencil2::bar_chart:.

# Dataset Context:
- The Urban Institute data science team used data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, IPUMS 2012-2018 ACS microdata, and Urbanâ€™s 2018 Census LODES data, in order to *estimate the number of low-income jobs lost because of COVID-19 by industry for every census tract in the US* based on the residence of workers. Low income those with (<$40,000 salary).
- Within the data, it *provides 20 names of the different work industries* so that we can compare the job loss index by state and by county across the country and see how they're different to each other. 
- The *numbers represent the count workers who live in which state, county, and the CBSA (Core-based statistical area: which is the geographic area  that consists of one or more counties) who lost their job*.

# Vocabulary:
- **QoL**: Quality of life index.
- **LIJ**: Low income jobs.

# Avenues explored thus far:
- **QoL Index:** We tried to explore the quality of life changes in every state between 2018 (pre-pandemic) and 2021 (mid-pandemic) in the hopes of finding some correlation between the quality of life of the whole state and the low income jobs lost due to COVID-19. Our exploration has not shown any significant correlation between quality of life and the LIJs lost. We also didn't find a strong correlation between fiscal stability, economic ranking, and the opportunity metric of each state and the estimated LIJs lost in the state.
- **Demographics impacted by LIJs lost:** In progress.
- **Patterns in job loss by industry**: In progress.
